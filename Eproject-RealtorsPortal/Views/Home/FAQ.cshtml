                        <b>A home is an investment.</b>
                        When you rent, you write your monthly check and that money is gone forever. 
                        But when you own your home, you can deduct the cost of your mortgage loan interest from your income taxes,
                        and usually from your taxable income. This will save you a lot each year, 
                        because the interest you pay will make up most of your monthly payment for most of the years of your mortgage. 
                        In addition, the value of your home may go up over the years. Finally,
                        you’ll enjoy having something that’s all yours – a home where your own personal style will tell the world who you are.

                      In most cases, the mortgage interest (and property tax) may be itemized and deducted from your taxable income, 
                      lowering your overall tax bill. This can make your after-tax cost of home ownership lower than renting.
                      However, there may be tax implications if you later sell the home at a profit. 
                      Please consult your tax adviser regarding interest deductibility.

                      They often are!
                      But don’t let that stop you. Now you begin negotiating. Your broker will help you. 
                      You may have to offer more money, 
                      but you may ask the seller to cover some or all of your closing costs or to make repairs that wouldn’t normally be expected. 
                      Often, negotiations on a price go back and forth several times before a deal is made. 
                      Just remember – don’t get so caught up in negotiations that you lose sight of what you really want and can afford!

                      The big question. You can’t get too far selling your home if you can’t put a price on it. 
                      If you hire a full-service real estate agent, they will use “comps”, short for comparables,
                      to help draw an accurate picture of what your home is currently worth.
                      Agents also draw upon years of experience and local, neighborhood insight to price your home.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-1">
                      If you’re a FSBO (For Sale By Owner), you can do some homework online and come up with a listing price on your own.
                      Visit sites such as MagicBricks, 99Acres, CommonFloor and search for homes in your neighborhood or town. 
                      Compare your home to the homes for sale or recently sold, and make your own valuation based on square footage. 
                      You can also spend a few bucks and hire a home appraiser, who will give you a full report and a number.

                     Bottom line, if you’re a home seller, you want a real estate agent who sells your home as quickly as possible for as much as possible. But what specific actions does the agent take to achieve that goal?
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-1">
                     An agent or Realtor’s first step is to price your home correctly. Next, they will help the seller with recommendations on decluttering, curb appeal and small repairs. Then they will list the home and market the home through a mix of traditional and digital channels. Staging and showing the home comes next, followed by (hopefully!) helping the seller negotiate with buyers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-1">
                     Of course, the above list is a highlight of the main things a seller’s agent will do in any successful transaction. However, there are many other details and duties an agent will complete on your behalf.

                    <p class="mb-1">
                     Some of the more popular moves to make include making small upgrades to the bathroom and kitchen: change out handles and fixtures, put in low-flow toilets, and paint or stain cabinets.

                     Go green by adding solar panels and consider putting in a tankless water heater. A relatively cheap way to spruce up your landscaping is to revive your lawn by laying new sod. A fresh coat of paint and new flooring will also go a long way in justifying your asking price.
